I would like to renovate my room. 
It will include the following tasks: 
removing the polystyrene panels from the ceiling, 
painting the walls and ceiling, 
sanding the parquet floor, 
installing shelves and curtain rods, 
replacing the chandelier.

I will start by removing all the furniture and carpet. 
Then I will remove the panels from the ceiling. 
The next step will be to clean the floor and sand the parquet floor. 
Then I will drill holes in the walls where the shelves and curtain rods are attached. 
The next step will be to remove dust from the walls and other surfaces. 
Then I will protect the floor, electrical sockets, windows, and window sills with foil and masking tape. 
Next, I will paint the ceiling and walls. 
Install the shelves and canopies. 
The last two things will be to install the new chandelier and bring the furniture back into the room.
